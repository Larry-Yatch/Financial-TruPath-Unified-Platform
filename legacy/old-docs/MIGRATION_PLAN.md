# Migration Plan: Financial TruPath Unified Platform

## üéØ Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Individual Web Apps (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal**: Convert each Google Apps Script tool into a modern web app

#### Step 1: Create Base Template
- [ ] Choose tech stack (React vs Vue vs Vanilla)
- [ ] Create starter template with:
  - Authentication boilerplate
  - Google Sheets API integration
  - Basic routing
  - Deployment config

#### Step 2: Migrate Existing Tools (Priority Order)
1. **Control Fear Investment Tool** (Week 1)
   - Most complex, good test case
   - Fear & Greed Index integration
   - Investment tracking

2. **Control Fear Grounding** (Week 2)
   - Similar structure to #1
   - Can reuse components

3. **Issues Showing Love** (Week 3)
   - Different domain, test flexibility

4. **External Validation** (Week 3)
   - Processing heavy, different patterns

5. **Financial Dashboard** (Week 4)
   - New tool, aggregates data from others

#### Step 3: Create New Tools
- [ ] Tool 6: _____________________
- [ ] Tool 7: _____________________
- [ ] Tool 8: _____________________

### Phase 2: Unified Platform (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Combine all apps into single platform

- [ ] Unified navigation/routing
- [ ] Shared authentication
- [ ] Cross-tool data sharing
- [ ] Consistent UI/UX
- [ ] Performance optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Decisions Needed

### Frontend Framework
**Options:**
1. **React** - Most popular, huge ecosystem
2. **Vue 3** - Simpler, great for forms
3. **Vanilla JS** - No dependencies, fastest

**Recommendation**: _TBD based on your experience_

### Data Layer
**Current**: Google Sheets via Apps Script
**Options for modernization:**
1. Keep Google Sheets (via Sheets API)
2. PostgreSQL/Supabase
3. Firebase Firestore
4. MongoDB

### Deployment
**Options:**
1. **Vercel** - Great for Next.js/React
2. **Netlify** - Simple, good for SPAs
3. **Google Cloud Run** - Stay in Google ecosystem
4. **GitHub Pages** - Free, simple

## üìã Pre-Migration Checklist

### For Each Tool:
- [ ] Document current features/functionality
- [ ] List all Google Sheets being used
- [ ] Identify API integrations
- [ ] Note any scheduled/trigger functions
- [ ] List user permissions/access patterns

### Questions to Answer:
1. **Authentication**: Use Google OAuth everywhere?
2. **Data Privacy**: Any HIPAA/financial compliance needed?
3. **Scale**: How many users? Concurrent?
4. **Mobile**: Responsive web or need native app later?

## üö¶ Next Immediate Steps

1. **Define the 3 new tools** - What will tools 6, 7, 8 do?
2. **Pick frontend framework** - What's your comfort level?
3. **Set up first app template** - Start with Control Fear Investment
4. **Test Google Sheets API** - Ensure we can read/write from web app

## üìä Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success:
- [ ] All 5 existing tools working as web apps
- [ ] 3 new tools defined and built
- [ ] Each deployable independently
- [ ] No loss of functionality

### Phase 2 Success:
- [ ] Single unified platform deployed
- [ ] Seamless navigation between tools
- [ ] Shared data working
- [ ] Better UX than original tools
