# SESSION HANDOFF - V9.7 Status Report

## üö® CURRENT STATUS - October 25, 2025

**Latest Version:** V9.7  
**Deploy ID:** `AKfycbyqrSzYPra9tqpbEMi27p-bmhEFhSdi5leEOpYq1UdtFVl5dgcB7b6AS4V9nXO14Y2P`  
**Decision Made:** Stop patching, rebuild foundation first

## üìä WHAT'S WORKING

1. **Authentication** - Login with TEST001/TEST002 works
2. **Sessions** - 24-hour session management functional
3. **Local Draft Saving** - Saves to browser localStorage correctly
4. **Tool 1 Display** - 25-question form displays properly
5. **Google Sheets Integration** - Data writes to sheets

## ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES (8 Found During Testing)

### Issue #1: Empty Load Dialog
- When no drafts exist, Load dialog is completely blank
- Should show "No previous sessions to load"

### Issue #2: Save Button Placement
- Save button appears on landing pages where nothing to save
- Should only appear during data entry

### Issue #3: Duplicate Progress Bars
- ToolWrapper progress bar AND index.html native progress
- Both showing different data

### Issue #4: Dashboard Return White Screen
- Clicking "Return to Dashboard" ‚Üí white screen
- Requires browser refresh to recover

### Issue #5: Progress Bar Confusion
- Unclear what progress bar tracks
- Shows 41% but section says "1 of 5"

### Issue #6: Duplicate Continue Buttons
- "Start Assessment" AND "Continue Previous (0%)"
- Inconsistent progress percentages

### Issue #7: Cloud Draft Saving BROKEN
- Creates 3 phantom versions with 0% progress
- No actual data saved to cloud
- Only timestamps are saved

### Issue #8: Cloud Draft Loading Returns Empty
- Loading any cloud draft brings no field data
- Confirms cloud drafts are empty shells

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**The Core Problem:** Two competing systems trying to manage the same functionality:
1. **ToolWrapper system** (our new framework)
2. **index.html native system** (original Tool 1)

These systems conflict at every level:
- Different progress tracking
- Different draft management
- Different form field collection
- Different navigation patterns

## ‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED IN V9 SERIES

- **V9.4:** Fixed dashboard navigation variables, draft loading structure, progress display
- **V9.5:** Added safety checks, fixed collectToolData for checkboxes/radios
- **V9.6:** Fixed draft versioning functions (but still broken due to architecture)
- **V9.7:** Fixed login redirect security error (window.top ‚Üí window.location)

## üéØ STRATEGIC DECISION

**Stop Patching, Rebuild Foundation**

After V9.7 and discovering 8 interconnected issues, decision made to:
1. Build clean foundation with test form first
2. Verify all persistence/progress/navigation works
3. Then rebuild Tool 1 using foundation
4. Scale to all 8 tools

See **FOUNDATION-ROADMAP.md** for complete plan.

## üìÅ CLEAN STATE ACHIEVED

**Database cleaned:**
- Sessions: 7 (cleaned from 43)
- Responses: 0 (cleaned from 11)
- Fresh start for testing

## üöÄ NEXT SESSION STARTUP

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /Users/Larry/code/Financial-TruPath-Unified-Platform/v2-sheet-script

# 2. Start monitoring (CRITICAL)
cd .. && node debug-sheets.js watch

# 3. Check recent work
mcp__hey-daddy__recall_daddy "V9"

# 4. Read the plan
cat Documentation/FOUNDATION-ROADMAP.md

# 5. Current deployment to test
open "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyqrSzYPra9tqpbEMi27p-bmhEFhSdi5leEOpYq1UdtFVl5dgcB7b6AS4V9nXO14Y2P/exec"
```

## üìã IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

1. **Create test form** with standardized structure
2. **Fix collectToolData()** to properly find form fields
3. **Fix cloud draft saving** (currently saves empty)
4. **Remove duplicate progress systems**
5. **Fix dashboard navigation**

## üí° KEY INSIGHT

**V9 series proved incremental fixes won't work.** The architectural conflict between ToolWrapper and native Tool 1 is fundamental. Clean foundation rebuild is the only path forward.
