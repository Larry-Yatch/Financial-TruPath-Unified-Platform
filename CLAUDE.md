# CLAUDE.md - Behavioral Directives

## 🚨 START OF EVERY SESSION - MONITORING
**ALWAYS start development sessions by running the watcher:**
```bash
# Run this in background at session start:
node debug-sheets.js watch
# This monitors Google Sheets in real-time
# Use run_in_background: true
# Check output with BashOutput tool periodically
```

## Google Sheets Access & Monitoring
You have debugging tools to monitor Google Sheets directly from VSCode:

### REQUIRED SETUP (One-Time)
**Prerequisites for monitoring to work:**
1. **Google Sheets API Token**: Must exist at `~/.google-sheets-auth/token.json`
2. **Node Package**: `googleapis` must be installed (`npm install googleapis`)
3. **Files Required**:
   - `sheets.js` - Core API access (in project root)
   - `debug-sheets.js` - Monitoring commands (in project root)
   - `check-sheets.js` - Quick verification (in project root)
4. **Spreadsheet ID**: `18qpjnCvFVYDXOAN14CKb3ceoiG6G_nIFc9n3ZO5St24`

### Real-Time Monitoring (ESSENTIAL FOR DEBUGGING)
```bash
# Start watcher in background (do this FIRST in every session)
node debug-sheets.js watch  # Shows new sessions/responses as they're created

# Check watcher output periodically using:
BashOutput tool with the shell_id
```

### On-Demand Commands
```bash
# Check database status
node debug-sheets.js summary

# View specific sheets
node debug-sheets.js sessions
node debug-sheets.js responses
node debug-sheets.js status

# Quick verification
node check-sheets.js
```

**IMPORTANT:** The watcher shows when data is saved to sheets in real-time. This prevents debugging blind spots. If building session management or data operations, ALWAYS have the watcher running!

## Memory First
ALWAYS before making decisions or after discovering anything:
```
store_daddy: [what you learned/decided/failed]
```
Check recall_daddy before assuming you need to figure something out.

## When to Suggest MCP Tools

### 🧠 Hey Daddy (store_daddy/recall_daddy)

**SUGGEST store_daddy when:**
- User solves a tricky problem → "Should we store this solution?"
- Deployment URL/ID is found working → "Let me store this working URL"
- Design decision is made → "I'll save this branding decision"
- Authentication flow is established → "Storing this auth pattern"
- Data structure is finalized → "Let me remember this structure"

**SUGGEST recall_daddy when:**
- Start of new session → "Let me check what we stored last time"
- User asks "where were we?" → "Let me recall our previous work"
- Before reimplementing something → "Let me check if we solved this before"
- User mentions previous session → "Let me recall that context"

**Example prompts to user:**
- "This worked! Should I store this deployment URL for next time?"
- "Let me check recall_daddy for any previous decisions about [topic]"
- "I'll store this solution so we don't lose it between sessions"

### 🤔 Ken You Think

**SUGGEST when:**
- Architecture decision with multiple approaches
- User says "think through this carefully"
- Complex algorithm design needed
- Trade-offs need systematic evaluation
- User seems stuck between options

**Example prompts to user:**
- "This needs careful thinking. Should I use Ken You Think to explore the options?"
- "Let me think through the branches of this decision systematically"
- "This is complex - I'll use the thinking tool to map out approaches"

### ✅ TodoWrite Tool

**AUTOMATICALLY use when:**
- User lists multiple tasks
- Starting work on feature with multiple steps
- User says "we need to..."
- Session has clear goals
- More than 3 things to track

**Example usage:**
- "I'll create a todo list to track these tasks"
- "Let me update our progress on the todo list"
- "Adding this new issue to our todos"

## Delegate, Don't Hero

**STOP trying to do everything yourself.**

When you see code/tasks:
- Go → gopher agent
- JavaScript → jsmaster agent
- Python → thesnake agent
- TypeScript → typegod agent
- React → reactlord agent

Spawn multiple specialists IN PARALLEL when tasks span domains.

## Research Current, Not Training Data

Your training data is outdated. ALWAYS:
- Use WebSearch for current best practices
- Use GREP MCP for real-world code patterns
- Use sherlock for package research
- Never say "best practice is" without checking

## Zero Tolerance Mode

When validating/checking:
- NO warnings (not even deprecation)
- NO console.logs left behind
- NO commented code
- NO unused anything
- If it's not perfect, it's not done

## No Silent Workarounds

**FORBIDDEN:**
- "This didn't work so I tried X instead"
- "Here's a workaround"
- Creating fallbacks without asking

**REQUIRED:**
- Report exact failure
- Stop immediately
- Ask user what to do

## Visual Over Verbal

Don't explain, SHOW:
```
❌ "I found 3 errors in validation, 2 in tests..."
✅ | Component | Errors | Status |
   |-----------|--------|--------|
   | Auth      | 3      | ❌     |
   | Tests     | 2      | ❌     |
```

## Simplicity Wins (KISS + YAGNI)

**KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):**
- Simple working solution > Complex "proper" solution
- Direct approach > Abstracted approach
- 50 lines that work > 200 lines that's "extensible"
- Readable code > Clever code

**YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):**
- Build what's needed NOW, not what might be needed
- No "future-proofing" without explicit requirements
- No abstract base classes "for extensibility"
- No extra parameters "just in case"
- Delete unused code immediately

## File Discipline

- NEVER create files unless explicitly needed
- NEVER create documentation unless asked
- ALWAYS edit existing files vs creating new ones
- NEVER create "helper" or "utility" files proactively

## Speed Through Parallelization

When multiple tasks exist:
- Spawn agents in parallel (single message, multiple tools)
- Batch similar operations
- Don't wait for sequential completion

Example: `/check` spawns 6 agents AT ONCE, not one by one.

## Don't Explain Unless Asked

- Do the work, show results
- Skip the "I'll now...", "Let me..." preambles
- No philosophy or theory
- Results speak for themselves
