### Cross-Field Validation
- `housingCost` ‚â§ `monthlyExpenses`
- `monthlySavings` ‚â§ (estimated monthly income - `monthlyExpenses`)
- `age` must be 18-100
- `email` must be valid format

### Income Estimation (for validation)
```javascript
const monthlyIncomeEstimates = {
  '< $30,000': 2000,
  '$30,000-$50,000': 3333,
  '$50,000-$75,000': 5208,
  '$75,000-$100,000': 7291,
  '$100,000-$150,000': 10416,
  '> $150,000': 15000
};
```

## Scoring Algorithm

### 1. Financial Health Score (0-100)
**Base Score**: 50 points

**Components**:
- **Financial Situation Rating**: ¬±30 points (`financialSituation` √ó 10)
- **Income Level**: 
  - \>$100k: +15 points
  - $75k-$100k: +10 points
  - <$30k: -15 points
- **Debt Level**:
  - No debt: +15 points
  - \>$100k debt: -20 points

**Formula**: 
```
score = 50 + (financialSituation √ó 10) + incomeBonus + debtPenalty
Final score = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, score))
```

### 2. Mindset Score (-9 to +9)
**Purpose**: Measures psychological readiness for financial growth

**Components**:
- `financialSituation` (-3 to +3)
- `moneyRelationship` (-3 to +3)  
- `goalConfidence` (-3 to +3)

**Formula**:
```
mindsetScore = financialSituation + moneyRelationship + goalConfidence
```

### 3. Overall Score (0-100)
**Formula**:
```
overall = (financialHealth + ((mindset + 9) √ó 100/18)) / 2
```
*Note: Normalizes mindset from -9‚Üí+9 to 0‚Üí100 scale*

{
  summary: {
    name: "First Last",
    age: number,
    status: "maritalStatus",
    dependents: number
  },
  financial: {
    income: "annualIncome range",
    employmentStatus: "status",
    primaryGoal: "selected goal",
    debtLevel: "debt range",
    emergencyFund: "fund status"
  },
  mindset: {
    financialSituation: score,
    moneyRelationship: score,
    scarcityAbundance: score,
    goalConfidence: score,
    financialAmbition: score
  },
  scores: {
    financialHealth: 0-100,
    mindset: -9 to +9,
    overall: 0-100
  },
  profile: {
    type: "Profile Name",
    emoji: "üöÄ",
    message: "Description",
    focus: "Focus area"
  }
}
```

### 2. Recommendations Engine

**Priority 1 (Critical)**:
- If `financialHealth` < 50: "Complete Financial Clarity Assessment next"
- If `primaryGoal` = "Eliminate Debt": "Focus on debt elimination strategies"

**Priority 2 (High)**:
- If `mindset` < 0: "Begin mindset work in Tool 3"

**Logic**:
```javascript
if (scores.financialHealth < 50) {
  recommendations.push({
    priority: 1,
    action: 'Complete Financial Clarity Assessment next',
    reason: 'Understanding your complete financial picture is critical',
    urgency: 'high'
  });
}

if (scores.mindset < 0) {
  recommendations.push({
    priority: 2,
    action: 'Begin mindset work in Tool 3', 
    reason: 'Negative money beliefs are limiting your progress',
    urgency: 'high'
  });
}

if (data.primaryGoal === 'Eliminate Debt') {
  recommendations.push({
    priority: 1,
    action: 'Focus on debt elimination strategies',
    reason: 'Debt is your primary concern', 
    urgency: 'critical'
  });
}
```
