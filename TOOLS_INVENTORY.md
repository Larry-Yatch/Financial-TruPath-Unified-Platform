# Financial TruPath Tools - Complete Inventory

## 📊 All 8 Tools Overview

### 🔄 Tool 1: Orientation - Demographics Tool
- **Status**: Exists as a Google Form and connected Google Spreadsheet
- **Current Location**: Form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1A_FjAQbk9fqqWrW7jKXeYl1xJX7EtwCERAjvKY9Xeys/edit
                         Spreadsheet Script ID: 1S3ujOblMA1pRX4e3YEWGjj03r3yqD7PpbttcohslVuDPx8-KS3HdV60H
- **Type**: (planned) Google Apps Script + HTML
- **Purpose**:   The purpose of this tool is to orient the client to the course and to gather important demographic / financial data from them that we will use later in our other apps.  We will provide a customized report that gives them some insights into some of the subconscious drivers of their financial limitations and therefore can tell them what upcoming sections of the course will apply directly to them.  Creating a feeling of excitement for the upcoming course content.
- **Google Sheets Used**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18JP-qzGaQwv2dGmqGaTZZ6TNAJORxGrCK6tIkc0xlM0/edit?gid=1856419087#gid=1856419087

- **Type**: Google Apps Script / at least a hybrid web app / Google Script
- **Purpose**: The purpose of this tool is to give every dollar of income into a person's life a job.

- A multiply bucket, which is concerned with retirement.
- A necessary expenses or needs bucket.
- A financial freedom bucket, which is emergency savings, short-term spending.

This app not only identifies the percentage distribution of each dollar into those four buckets but talks about how and why that distribution was made through a customized report.

- **Purpose**: The purpose of this tool is to identify the current financial situation of the client and their desired future, which helps us determine urgency in getting there as well as their ambition between three domains of savings for retirement.

Then, understanding the current demographic situation which determines the IRS limitations on which retirement vehicles are available to them, we utilize the importance and urgency being able to order those retirement vehicles and cascade their available retirement dollars—both from an actual where they are today standpoint and an ideal standpoint—across all those retirement vehicles.

Producing a customized retirement blueprint that helps guide them into creating the retirement structures necessary to create the future they want.
