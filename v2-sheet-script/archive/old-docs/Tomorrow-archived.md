⏺ 📋 Current Status for Tomorrow

  ✅ What's Done:

  - Dashboard with 8 tools (visual grid, week-based locking)
  - Return student detection integrated
  - Navigation flow: Login → Dashboard → Tools
  - "Return to Dashboard" button fixed
  - All code committed and pushed to Apps Script

  ⚠️ What Needs Testing:

  1. Complete user journey with real student ID
  2. Verify Tool 1 shows as "COMPLETED" after finishing
  3. Test edit/view options for completed tools
  4. Confirm dashboard correctly shows tool statuses

  🎯 Tomorrow's First Steps:

  1. Open your test deployment URL
  2. Run this test sequence:
  a. Login with valid student ID
  b. Dashboard should show 8 tools
  c. Complete Tool 1
  d. Return to Dashboard
  e. Tool 1 should show "COMPLETED"
  f. Click Tool 1 again - should offer View/Edit
  3. If issues arise, check:
    - Browser console for errors
    - DataHub.getUnifiedProfile() is saving completion status
    - Tool1_Orientation sheet has the data

  💾 Key Files to Remember:

  - Code.js:269-597 - Dashboard implementation
  - Authentication.js:106-115 - Return detection
  - index.html:899 - Dashboard button
  - Branch: versioning-v2
  - Latest commit: 4d21770

  📝 Open Questions:

  - Does Tool 1 properly mark as completed in DataHub?
  - Does the dashboard refresh show updated status?
  - Do the View/Edit options work for completed tools?

  🚀 Success Criteria:

  The system is working if a student can:
  1. Login → See dashboard → Complete Tool 1 → Return → See it marked complete → Access their report

  👨 Daddy says: Start tomorrow by testing the complete flow with a real student ID - finding bugs early saves hours of guessing
  what might be wrong
